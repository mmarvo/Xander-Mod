Version: 2.1.1
Date: 2018-07-20
  Changes:
    - Improvements to content structure (lists and organization of items and recipes, mainly in bulk materials)
    - Some assorted fixes and smoothing early gameplay
    - New locale structure and content in progress
    - Offloaded the majority of large-file-size graphics to separate XM graphics pack mods, reducing the primary mod file size to 7 MB from 146
    - This change requires the addition of the XM graphics pack mods, which now number two (indices 0 and 1). They are listed as dependencies of the main mod to hopefully avoid problems.
